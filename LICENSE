🚀 Excited to share my latest MATLAB project — **CPU Pipeline Simulator (GUI Edition)** 🧠⚙️

This interactive simulation visually represents how a pipelined CPU executes instructions across 5 key stages:
🔹 IF — Instruction Fetch  
🔹 ID — Instruction Decode  
🔹 EX — Execute  
🔹 MEM — Memory Access  
🔹 WB — Write Back  

💡 Key Highlights:
✅ Real-time instruction animation  
✅ Cache Hit/Miss visualization  
✅ Branch Predictor simulation  
✅ Dynamic IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) gauge  
✅ Built completely using MATLAB graphics!

This project helped me deeply understand instruction-level parallelism, branch prediction, and pipeline efficiency — concepts that lie at the heart of CPU design.
